# C-Clock-with-Chrono -- Digital& Analog

I made in C, with the help of a graphic library, an analog and digital clock, this sums up several options including:
- alarm setting 
- time zone tracking worldwide 
- timer
- time display in analog and digital format 
-hourglass
and many others, the design is friendly and easy to use.
